-----------------ABOUT ARTAX---------------- 

Artax is an exciting new Community Cryptocurrency. The community governance and management of Artax Coin has been compared to that of Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Litecoin. Artax did not have an ICO and there was no presale. The original chain was designed for the purposes of testing and community development. Read more about the Artax Coin Open-Source committee structure at the Github link below. The Artax Volunteer Committee is made up of unpaid community members put in place to experiment with the chain. Artax was originally launched as a PoW coin and the only way you could get coins was by mining. As the committee changed hands and the coin progressed with the times Artax became PoW/PoS then PoS/MN. Artax is now changing again (keeping up the modern technology) to Pure PoS. The Artax community is implementing an aim to provide a complete cryptocurency solution for mobile asset transfer and to vanish the difficulty around constraints on currencies. Artax technology could be used as a payment mode for bartering providers in the future. After the recent year of development from our committee volunteers, Artax is now shifting to rollout its DaaS chain per the original BCT announcement and roadmap.
