Artax Core - Community Driven Project. NO ICO. NO PRESALE  -=RECENT HISTORY=-
=============

Very similar to Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin -  Artax is a community volunteer driven project.
---------------------


Artax Coin started out with great promise. A solid footing of six or seven volunteer dev committee members all from different communities. Everyone actively developing and with Proof-of-Work only. Instamine for coin testing held by multiple committee volunteers in multi-sig wallets and a public ledger. The original XAX committee team was devoted and had a great co-operative approach to development. This was the envy of many. 

People lost XAX when coinsmarkets exchange vanished and the first chain hack took place. XAX PoW/PoS pools went missing then Maple Exchange was hacked. Alot of people lost enthusiasm over these times. The XAX community lost majority of its coins and volume over this period which co-incided with the bear market. A brief swap was planned by the committee lead at that time (see the ARTAX_COMMITTEE.txt pre-amble). New committee members were added, some were replaced. The guy who controlled the artax website was great and replaced the XAX dumped by others from his own collection to the chain. All was well until the chain got hacked again. Swaps and revivals have kept this community project alive.

In accordance with the original manifesto: committee members/contributors are not obliged to stay with the project and everyone is free todo as they wish. A communal approach. This is so long as they pass on any assets that are held. Alot of committee volunteers have come and gone and a governance revival ensued after several exchanges were hacked. There was a proposal for 40k XAX from the chain every month to pay for hosting and new development/listings. This was voted through governance and a committee initiative. Later this proposal was abolished.

So many great people have come and gone, alot still here from the start making Artax an absolute standout in the crypto sphere. Soley community and committee driven with true governance and not controlled by one leader or centralized whales.

Despite the bear market, chain and exchange hacks, Artax soldiers on thanks to the will of the volunteers!
