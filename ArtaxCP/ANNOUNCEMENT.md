Contrary to the Bitcointalk Announcement. The Volunteer Committee member that posted this announcement did not clear all the facts with the committee before posting. Proprietary licences were 
intiailly intented for future changes to certain items. This is still undecided and not confirmed by the Artax Volunteer Committee. There must be consensus before these decisions are made.
The announcement was not original but a modified cut and paste from the Wickr/Discord/Telegram Announcement.

Corrections-
All Artax Development is "Open-Source" and Community driven, there are no proprietary components at this stage.
ECP (Encryption Cache Persistence) is not "proprietary", it is open-source and it was built/adapted from the original Redis open-source dictionary server and work by other developers.
The Artaxq algo is not built on Quark-Hash, rather it is the combination of keccak and echo.
ARTNodes are not "proprietary" however some of the volunteers have declared that licence changes could be made on the code in the future.
The Artaxq Algo is not "proprietary",  it is an open-source hashing algorithm (Combination of keccak and echo). 
The Artaxq cipher is also Open-Source.
The latest Artax codebase used the  Sha256 Algo.
The Artax Blockchain and Software is experimental and should be used at your own risk.

The intention of come of the volunteer committee was that in the future possible  propreiatry components would be created and maintained in licence form only.
