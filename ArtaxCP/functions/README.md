# Library Functions

This is a bunch of simple library functions for Artax. I use them for decoding the raw transaction data found in Artax's `blk.dat` files (binary files containing the blockchain).

I wrote this library for speed. For a more comprehensive library, check out [artax-php](https://github.com/Bit-Wasp/artax-php)
