Contributing to Artax Core
============================

The Artax Core project operates an open contributor model where anyone is
welcome to contribute towards development in the form of peer review, testing
and patches. This document explains the practical process and guidelines for
contributing. The contributor model is regualted by our Artax volunteer committee. 

Firstly in terms of structure, there is no particular concept of "Core
developers" in the sense of privileged people. There is a lead to the dev-committee which has changed chands numerous times. Open source often naturally
revolves around meritocracy where longer term contributors gain more trust from
the developer community. However, some hierarchy is necessary for practical
purposes. As such there are repository "maintainers" who are responsible for updating the codebase as per the wishes of the committee.
